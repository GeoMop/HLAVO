1. make a lib part of processing and virtual environment, move to workspace
2. separate notebooks for processing of different measurements with interpretation

- linear phase shift not correct since we does not cover whole signal periods 
- we should rather fit function 
  a + b*f + c*sin(d*f) 
- better model of impact of the connection line, seems that we can do calibration on VNA for the V11 setup
  but definitely not for V12, where we struggle to properly compensate the source signal
