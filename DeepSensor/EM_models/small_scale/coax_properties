r - resistivity of conductor
eps - absolute permitivity of conductor = eps_0 * eps_r
eps_0 = 8.85e-12 F/m

copper, eps = inf

skin_depth = sqrt(2*r/omega/mu) sqrt(sqrt(1+(r*omega*eps)**2) + r *omega * eps)

shunt (parallel) capacitance and conductance:
C = 2*pi*eps_0 * Re(eps_r) / ln(r_0 / r_i)
G = 2*pi*omega*eps_0 * Im(Re(eps_r) / ln(r_0 / r_i)
